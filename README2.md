## &&&& Project Name: ReactTodo & ##
## https://github.com/carmitvinik/ReactTodo
## Since Oct 2020
This is a client side implementation of TodoList Application
It's work along side with [nodeTodo] server which can be downloaded 
at [https://github.com/carmitvinik/nodeTodo]  
for localhost use and development 
The todo GUI is in hebrew language 
Sort of Translation implementation To any language from english 
can be found at [/src/component/form/joiHeb.js] and should be in seperate file /* for later on */

For using the Todo You need to create user acount after successful installing
And go to the Third link in the menu navigation bar (from right to left(RTL)) 

There you can add your own todo which is being represented in table form
for right now with the column:
# | Title | isDone | createdAt
1 | clean | [V]    | 1.10.2020 [-delet button-]  [-edit button-]     

Since you check the checkbos, it means the Todo is done and
if you want to change it you ll need to edit it by the edit button.

## Data API Server Configuration ##
API URL for the [nodeTodo] can be configured at [/src/component/config.json]

Good luck :D
